### IN PROGRESS

#### Proof of Concept Pt. 2 (10/17/23 to ) - Ignition
    After completing "Combustion" to prevent future inefficiecy, I am excited to get back to making tangible progess
    and seeing the results of my labor.

    Ignition will be the first large step to completing the core goal of this project. More specifically, smolder is the
    planning, finding, acquiring, and storing of ALL the required data for player single game fantasy outcome prediction.
    
    QUESTIONS
        - What is a workable structure for NFL data and ML interpretation?
        - How would the code represent this?
        - Where can I find the required stats?
        - How much will this information cost?
        - What way will I acquire this data?
        - How will I combine these stats into my structured environment
        - How will I store this data?
        - How will I update this data?

    OBJECTIVES
    1) Determine data requirements
    2) Locate data
    3) Acquire data
    4) Store data
##




### TODO ROADMAP

#### Embers
    Transform the data for ML
##

#### Flame
    Train and predict from a single model, determine validity and mistakes
##

#### Fire
    Research and improve the function of the ml models and/or data and it's structure
##

#### Blaze
    Study DFS contest lineup composition and entry variation
##

#### Inferno
    Using previous findings, implement DFS lineup selection and variation functionality
##




#### Internet Hosting - Droplet
    - Install required libraries/project on a server and it IS functioning
    - Design requests handling system for backend usability and security
    - Design web app dashboards for project health and model analysis (requires: LOGGING)
##




### COMPLETED
#### Proof of Concept - Spark (10/4/23 to 10/10/23)
    While this was a fairly swift effort, only taking a weeks worth of work to build from scratch, there were some  
    minor lapses in code quality. This will require a Tech Debt effort to rethink and repair the systems fluidity for  
    all the required use cases, see "Combustion".
##

#### Tech Debt Pt. 1 - Combustion (10/11/23 to 10/15/23)
    This task was created in response to a lack of efficiency in the initial design of the system. While it was coded
    well, meeting the needs to produce an effective proof of concept, it needs to be redesigned to evade future time
    dumps while adding resources for other project avenues.

    The goal of the "Combustion" adaptation is to improve the function and flow of core functionalities before adding
    additional research operations.

    OBJECTIVES
    1) Redesign the structure of the major project systems for ease in future project model data repetitions
        - Compartmentalized and improve data pipeline methods, model training, and model prediction functionalities
        - Created a server request architecture system to access functionality through requests at a high level
        - Added the possibility to differentiate between update and initialize operations

    2) Improve error handling
        - Replaced printing with logging
