### IN PROGRESS

#### Tech Debt Pt. 1 (10/11/23) - Reformation
    This task was created in response to a lack of efficiency in the initial design of the system. While it was coded
    well, meeting the needs to produce an effective proof of concept, it needs to be redesigned to evade future time
    dumps.

    The goal of the "Reformation" adaptation is to improve the function and flow of core functionalities before adding
    additional research operations.

    OBJECTIVES
    1) Improve Data Pipeline methods to prevent cross controller requirements for loading/preprocessing prediction data
    2) Differentiate between update and initialize operations
    2) Replace printing with logging
    3) Incorporate server functionalities into the high level system entry design

##
### TODO
#### Proof of Concept Pt. 2 () - Smolder
    - 

#### Proof of Concept Pt. 3 () - Ablaze
    - 

#### Hosting
    - Install required libraries/project on a server and it IS functioning
    - Design requests handling system for backend usability and security
    - Design web app dashboards for project health and model analysis (requires: LOGGING)

##
### COMPLETED
#### Proof of Concept Pt. 1 (10/4/23 - 10/10/23) - Ashes
    While this was a fairly swift effort, only taking a weeks worth of work to build from scratch, there were some  
    minor lapses in code quality. This will require a Tech Debt effort to rethink and repair the systems fluidity for  
    all the required use cases, see "Reformation".

### Parking Lot
    Requests Class/Handler - would require the need for web app interactions
