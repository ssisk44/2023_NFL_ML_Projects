#### Hosting
    - Install required libraries/project on a server and it IS functioning
    - Design requests handling system for backend usability and security
    - Design web app dashboards for project health and model analysis (requires: LOGGING)

### COMPLETED
#### Proof of Concept Pt. 1 (10/4/23 - 10/10/23) - Ashes
    While this was a fairly swift effort, only taking a weeks worth of work to build from scratch, there were some  
    minor lapses in code quality. This will require a Tech Debt effort to rethink and repair the systems fluidity for  
    all the required use cases, see "Reformation".

#### Tech Debt Pt. 1 (10/11/23) - Reformation
    This task was created in response to a lack of efficiency in the initial design of the system. While it was coded
    well, meeting the needs to produce an effective proof of concept, it needs to be redesigned to evade future time
    dumps while adding resources for other project avenues.

    The goal of the "Reformation" adaptation is to improve the function and flow of core functionalities before adding
    additional research operations.

    OBJECTIVES
    1) Redesign the structure of the major project systems for ease in future project model data repetitions
        - Compartmentalized and improve data pipeline methods, model training, and model prediction functionalities
        - Created a server request architecture system to access functionality through requests at a high level
        - Added the possibility to differentiate between update and initialize operations

    2) Improve Error Handling
        - Replaced printing with logging

### Parking Lot
    Requests Class/Handler - would require the need for web app interactions
