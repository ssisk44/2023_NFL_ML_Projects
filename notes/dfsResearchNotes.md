##DFS Research

Here are list of my proposed research fields in the study of contest lineup entry optimization:
1) Expected Player Outcomes
   1) come as close as possible to predicting player usage and success
####
2) Lineup Property Categories - identify and capitalize upon common similarities among successful entries
   1) game stacking
   2) salary by position distributions/combos
   3) position-team combinations
   4) under/overloading a team
   5) game exposure  
####
4) Contest Multi-Entry Strategy
   1) maximize player-lineup exposure efficiency
      1) overlap
      2) player pool cover
      3) entry count
