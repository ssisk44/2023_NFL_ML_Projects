>1. Can I accurately describe the branch of mathematics this projects core problems falls under? **Yes**

> "We’ll be solving this problem with dynamic programming. Dynamic programming requires an optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems, both of which are present in the 0–1 knapsack problem, as we shall see.

> It’s fine if you don’t understand what “optimal substructure” and “overlapping sub-problems” are (that’s an article for   another day). Essentially, it just means a particular flavor of problems that allow us to reuse previous solutions to smaller problems in order to calculate a solution to the current problem. You’ll see what I mean in a bit."
