> Thesis: identify a DFS multi-lineup submission methodology that demonstates historic profitability.

### Lets explain DFS
1) DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports) is a new gambling method that requires participants to select athletes to create a lineup.
2) The goal is to choose the highest scoring lineup out of all the entrants to win. Each player has a different salary depending on their predicted output.
3) The score is determined by a simple math formula (ex. NFL Rushing TD is 6).
4) Winning different types of contest, depending on entry fee, will reward you with different profitablity margins.
5) Coming in first is not required, there is a preset percent of players that will win and lose.
